# Guide to contributing

## Contributing with an issue
Please write the reasons why you think the change is necessary. If it is a **feature request**, explain the use cases; 
if it is a **bug**, explain the buggy case in detail.

## Contributing with a Pull Request
Please, create an issue first if it involves coding. In that cases, add test cases to the folder /test and be sure all test cases succeed.

Feel free to submit Pull Requests for non-coding issues or improvements.
